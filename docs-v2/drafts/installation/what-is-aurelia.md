# What is Aurelia

Well, it's actually simple. Aurelia is just JavaScript. However, it's not yesterday's JavaScript, but the JavaScript of tomorrow. By using modern tooling we've been able to write Aurelia from the ground up in ECMAScript 2016. This means we have native modules, classes, decorators and more at our disposal...and you have them too.

Not only is Aurelia written in modern and future JavaScript, but it also takes a modern approach to architecture. In the past, frameworks have been monolithic beasts. Not Aurelia though. It's built as a series of collaborating libraries. Taken together, they form a powerful and robust framework for building Single Page Apps (SPAs). However, Aurelia's libraries can often be used individually, in traditional web sites or even on the server-side through technologies like NodeJS.

Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, Aurelia sticks closely to real web standards. Modern Javascript features such as classes and decorators are first-party citizens in Aurelia as are specifications such as Web Components, Fetch (via Aurelia Fetch Client) and more.

Aurelia's core philosphy is to leverage existing API's and browser specifications, adding in only what is missing (like native data binding). As browsers support more parts of specifications such as TC39 ECMAScript releases and Web Components, Aurelia will sit back and let the transpiler and browsers do the work.
