# Preparing Your Machine

Much like most other modern Javascript frameworks, you will need to ensure that your machine supports the various build tooling and package managers Aurelia requires to run. At the very minimum, you will need to have Node.js and Npm (included with the downloaded installer) installed for tooling and installing Aurelia framework dependencies.

## Install Node.js

You need to install Node.js v6.x on your machine and the best way to install Node is via one of the officially provided installers from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

It is recommended that you install one of the LTS versions as they trail the current release and are more stable. If you install one of the current versions of Node, keep in mind that some things may not work as intended.

## Install a Git client

When creating a web application, it is recommended that you choose Git as your source control of choice. There are many choices when it comes to Git clients and some of our favourites are:

- UI Client: [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- UI Client: [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
- Official (non UI focused): [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

For a larger list of GUI Git clients, the Git SCM site has a great list [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) with some of the aforementioned choices and a few more that you can pick from.

## Install an IDE/Code Editor

Just like there are many choices for Git clients, the same thing goes for IDE's and code editors. If you haven't already got a favourite code editor or IDE, we highly recommend Visual Studio Code[https://code.visualstudio.com/] which is a 100% and open source code editor from Microsoft that works on all major operating systems that also has a nice extension ecosystem and supports working with many formats.
